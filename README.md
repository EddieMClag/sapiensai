# Sapiens.AI - Landing (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Project generated by ChatGPT as requested. This is a starter template containing:
- React + Vite frontend (single-page landing)
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Example serverless endpoints (OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini placeholder, image upload placeholder)
- Vercel configuration (vercel.json)

## Quick start (local)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment (Vercel recommended)
- This repo is ready to deploy on Vercel. Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY  (for ChatGPT example)
  - GOOGLE_API_KEY  (for Gemini example) -- optional
- The `api/` folder contains Node serverless functions. Vercel will map them to `/api/*` endpoints automatically.

## Notes
- The OpenAI and Gemini examples are templates: you must add your API keys and may need to adjust request formats or libraries per provider.
- Image upload endpoint is a placeholder that stores files temporarily within the serverless environment and returns a simulated result. Replace with cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage) for production.
